* EACH WEB APPLICATION IS UNIQUE AND MAY CONTAIN UNIQUE VULNERABILITIES 
* web application need to connect with various services locally where they exist
* New attacks have been conceived that were not considered when existing applications were developed. 
* As client side application is outside of control users can submit arbitary information to the server side application 
* users can tweak the data --> body , header , request url , cookies 
* any security precautions implemented in the client side can be easily broken 
* Users can send requests in any sequence and can submit parameters at a different stage than the application expects, more than once, or not at all 
* The majority of attacks against web applications involve sending input to the server that is crafted to cause some event that was not expected or desired by the applicationâ€™s designer.  
* removing , modifying , order , quantity  
* web applications must accept and process UNTRUSTED DATA   
* attack against users vs attack against the servers
